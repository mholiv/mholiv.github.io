<h1>Secret Hitler Overview</h1>
<p>This project was simple enough to not warrant a series of update blog posts.</p>
<p>The only trouble I had was getting OpenSCAD to output files suitable for multi material prints.</p>
<p>Eventually my solution was to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export a <code>.stl</code> file containing only the stand with a negative space with the text</li>
<li>Export a <code>.stl</code> file containing only the text. This should fit in the exact same spot as the negative.</li>
<li>Select both of these and import them into PrusaSlicer together. Select that you want to import these <code>.stl</code> as a single object.</li>
<li>Repeat for every bit name tag you want to make.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is better documented in the OpenSCAD file in the github repo. There may be a better way but at the time of creation there was no easy way I could find.</p>
<p>This was my first multi material/color print. Yay!</p>

<p>A quick multi material 3d print project I put together for a friend. These are used in the VERY fun (and freely available) <a href="https://www.secrethitler.com/">Secret Hitler Game</a>. If you like the game I would encourage you to support the creators by purchasing a pre printed card set from them.</p>
