<h1>A Call For A New Culture</h1>
<p>Why we need to work towards a higher culture based on fairness, openness, technology, and post-scarcity thinking.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Humanity is advancing on an ever-advancing path of technological advancement. This technological development has resulted in an easing of human labor and has greatly benefited those privileged peoples of the developed nations and to a lesser degree those peoples of the developing nations.</p>
<p>With the advancement of distributed manufacturing technologies like 3D printers and readily available multi-axis CNC milling machines, along with open source software and hardware, we are entering a time in which the relationship between humanity and production can be altered.</p>
<p>This document calls for the creation of a culture that seeks to harness the power of these distributed manufacturing technologies in order to create a society in which the basics (and eventually the luxuries) of life are readily available for everyone. This document proposes that this can and ought to be done via the creation of automated processes that can produce these goods with minimal, to no human interaction.</p>
<p>This document proposes further that a culture with the goals of furnishing everyone with these goods as its basis will be positioned to, and ought to, and will naturally be led to a society which values enshrine individual and social dignity and wellbeing.</p>
<p>This document is not proposing a radical denouncement of our current collective culture or society. Even if a new culture would be created and embraced it would still need to interact, economically, and intrasocietally with the status quo for a very long time. This document advocates for a voluntary, steady approach to the goal of a new culture.</p>
<h2>Openness, Technology, and Ownership</h2>
<p>This document proposes that by building on the following three pillars we can better and more fairly achieve the proposed goals of this document.</p>
<h3>Open Source &amp; Well Documented Designs</h3>
<p>Embracing open source hardware and software design enable people to benefit from a generalized Stallman style four essential freedoms. Namely:</p>
<p>The freedom to use any good as you wish.
The freedom to study how the good works, and change it as desired.
The freedom to create copies of the good so you can help others.
The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.
This document proposes that this is a sound foundation by which members of a new culture can avoid compulsion by means of their goods. This document further proposes that all designs works and acts of creativity be released under copyleft licenses to further protect and enable all people.</p>
<h3>Designs That Focus on Horizontal Scaling</h3>
<p>This document proposes that a focus on modular, horizontally scaling technology enables all people to benefit from new technology. By focusing on something like horizontally scaling farming equipment we increase both the productivity of the mega farm and the quality of life of the home gardener. Such technological advancements should be made for everyone.</p>
<h3>Prioritization of Using Distributed Manufacturing Methods</h3>
<p>In order to enable all people to benefit from technological advances, this document proposes that distributed manufacturing methods should be prioritized where possible. Certainly, (for now) it is the case that not all goods can be manufactured with distributed manufacture methods; in this case this document advocates for using open source and readily available substitutes.</p>
<h2>Post Scarcity Thinking</h2>
<p>This document advocates for thinking in a forward manner. Considering the facts of today and the facts of tomorrow. In this line, a new culture should aim for a post-scarcity society that benefits everyone. In aiming for such a lofty goal a new culture sets a bright horizon to look to.</p>
<h2>Action Oriented Approach</h2>
<p>Lastly, this document advocates for an action-oriented approach. Like minded people should work together to achieve noble goals.</p>
